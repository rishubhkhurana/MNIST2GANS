Experimentation--
1. Tried several architectures-- VGG16,Resnet50, inceptionv3 and handcrafted resenet. Finally settled with handcrafted resnet. 
2. Tried label smoothing on selected classes of age, emotion and weight. But no improvement was found
3. Tried Mixup augmentation and somehow, in this problem, that turned out to be really bad. 
4. Finally settled with augmentation using albumentations library
5. created lr_finder and one cycle scheduler callbacks. 


Final validation accuracy achieved
